# Plotting Playground

Welcome to my plotting playground!  

This repo is my personal space to experiment with Python libraries like **Matplotlib**, **NumPy**, and other visualization tools. Right now, most of the stuff here is super beginner-level, but I’m learning and trying out different things to get better at plotting and graphing.  

## What You’ll Find Here
- Simple 2D line plots and scatter plots  
- Trying out **Matplotlib** styles, colors, and layouts  
- Exploring **NumPy** for creating data to plot  
- Hopefully some cools things in the near future

## Goal
The goal is to take what I learn in class or on my own and turn it into something visual and interactive. Over time, I hope this playground grows into a collection of neat, engaging, and even complex visualizations. Right now, I’m thinking about things like Mandelbrot sets or real 3D functions, but I’d also love to explore animating them and letting users interact with the visuals to see how they behave. This could be especially useful since I’m interested in experimenting with some mathematical research in the future.

## How to Use
You can clone the repo and try out the scripts for yourself. Each file is usually a small experiment, so feel free to tinker with it and see what happens! Right now might not be the best idea as I need to clean up the code first 😅 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/plotting-playground.git
